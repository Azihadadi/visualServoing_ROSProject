## Dependencies


## Getting your marker in the Gazebo world:
Paste a folder containing your template in 'gazeboResources' into your gazebo resources directory.

Usually, this is a hidden folder in your 'home' directory, named '.gazebo'. Paste the folder inside '.gazebo/models/'. In your Gazebo, you'll now be able to 'insert' your template, check the insert pane!

Now, Gazebo is able to add template into a world.
